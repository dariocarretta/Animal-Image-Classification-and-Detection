# Animal-Image-Classification-and-Detection
This repository contains a project based on a University Exam I took for a Deep Learning and Neural Network course. The project's aim was to try to create a Deep Learning model that could classify some images and detect the area of the image in which the object was present. The dataset that was used can be found on Kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maricinnamon/caltech101-butterfly-dalmatian-dolphin/data), and it is a subset of the Caltech 101 dataset, containing only images of butterflies, dalmatians and dolphins.
